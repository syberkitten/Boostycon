# Boostycon

The Boostya is a humorous and ambigous (self-referencing) dialect  used to facilitate interaction between
collegues in high tech industries and in tight work environments where
not enough words exist (or available to the Boosties) to express certain emotions / hierarchies and foolisheness.

Being a "boosty" means that you've been initiated into the dialect circle 
and that you are accepted.
